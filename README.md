## How to contribute

You can add a translation for your own language. 

- [fork this repository](https://github.com/ASchmidt1024/monero-for-merchants-booklet/fork)
- add a new folder in directory `translations`, e.g. “es” for spanish
- create a translation-spanish.md
- translate an existing one (e.g. [translation-english.md](/translations/en/translation-english.md))
- create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui)

The pull request of a translation should be proofread by a native speaker. The PDF is then placed in the newly created folder and a README with preview images is created by us.

Found a spelling or other mistake? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/ASchmidt1024/monero-for-merchants-booklet/issues/new/choose) for it. Thank you.
